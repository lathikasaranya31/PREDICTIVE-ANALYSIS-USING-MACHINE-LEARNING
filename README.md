# THE DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE TASK THAT I HAVE DONE

# THE DATASET USED IS IRIS DATASET AND THE EDITING USED IS Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda), the programming language used is python. The libraries used are scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
# The aim is to build a predictive machine learning model that can accurately predict outcomes based on historical data. This task falls under supervised learning, where we train a model using labeled data to classify or predict future values. we used the Iris Dataset, a very famous and widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample having the following four numeric feature are Sepal length, sepal width, Petal length and Petal width. Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda Navigator) was used to write and execute code in a clean, cell-based format.scikit-learn (sklearn) was used to load the dataset, preprocess data, split data into training and testing sets, and to build the machine learning model. pandas was used for creating and manipulating data frames. seaborn and matplotlib were used for visualization of patterns and distributions in the data.The model was built and evaluated in the same notebook to maintain clarity and continuity of workflow. 
# The Iris dataset was loaded directly using the load_iris() function from sklearn.datasets. It was converted into a pandas DataFrame and the target values (0, 1, 2) were mapped to their respective flower species. Basic exploration was done to inspect the first few rows and data types. A seaborn pairplot was generated to visualize relationships between features and how they differ across species. All four features were used as input features (independent variables), while the flower species was selected as the output variable (target). The data was split into training and test sets using an 80-20 split with train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.A Random Forest Classifier was used for classification. This ensemble model uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. The model was trained on the training data. The trained model was evaluated on the test set using Accuracy Score,Classification Report and Confusion Matrix.
# The model achieved a high accuracy in predicting the species of iris flowers. This task demonstrated the end-to-end pipeline of building a machine learning model â€” from loading data and selecting features to training, evaluating, and drawing insights. The use of Jupyter Notebook helped in maintaining clarity and step-wise execution, while tools like scikit-learn made it easy to implement powerful machine learning techniques.
